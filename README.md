#Email Ai Automationt
Created an ai agent, to pull all my emails in the past 24 hours, that haven't been read, classify whether someone is asking about my well being ex: "how i am doing", "whats new"  things of this nature, and based on this response the ai will create a custom response based on the email they sent, and will send this email to that person. The purpose of this project is to grow foundational skills in ai agents, and to automate a repetetive process some people do not feel like solving on their own. This script can be ran every 24 hours, and will save a great deal of time.
